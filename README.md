# PCA-Implementation-from-Scratch
In this project, I implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch in Python, without using any inbuilt libraries, to understand the underlying mathematical concepts. The implementation includes data preprocessing, covariance matrix computation, eigenvalue/eigenvector extraction, and dimensionality reduction.
